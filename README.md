It is purchaseManagement App for my office, we don't have any kind of system
so they are just order parts by their voice, not text, it make me hard
so I made this app for they use it, and also they are really really old men,
so I want this app to easy to use so that they can use it

## Development

Run `npm install` inside the `functions` directory before using npm scripts like `npm run lint`.

On Windows use `gradlew.bat` for Gradle tasks (e.g., `gradlew.bat assembleDebug`).
